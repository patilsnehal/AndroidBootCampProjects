ToDo App Demo

This is an Android demo application for adding and deleting items in the todo list. It uses text file to store the todo items.
Time spent: 3 hours spent in total
Completed user stories:
 Required: User can view a list of existing todo items
 Required: User can add a new item to the todo list
 Required: User can remove an item from the todo list
 This first version will not support "marking" completion or setting priority, but we could add this in a future version.

Notes:
Spent some time learning file api and how to add common.io.fileutilities to the project.
